//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

//Contract Descriptions
	name = KSP-SR-70000m
	title = Fly a sounding rocket to space!
	group = Kerbal Sounding Project
	agent = Kerbal Sounding Project
	
	description = Now is the time to reach the edge of space with a sounding rocket! Jebediah Kerman is proud of what we've achieved so far and says the pressure is on to succeed where others have failed.\n\nGene Kerman, KSP's mission controller, says government representatives will be in attendance at the launch, ready to award the Kerbal Sounding Project with a formal transition to the Kerbal Space Program, assuming we are successful.
	
	synopsis = Launch the Avionics Package above the Kerman line using USI sounding rocket parts, and recover it.
	
	notes = It was safe. Then it quickly became apparent that this expectation was actually an illusion based on nothing but blind luck.
	
	completedMessage = Our rocket made it to the edge of space!\n\nAfter successful recovery of our rocket, a governent representative handed Gene Kerman a stack of papers to sign.\n\nThe ceremony was awe-inspiring as the cameras rolled and clicked and Jebediah Kerman gave a speech. It was then announced that the Kerbal Sounding Program was formally being re-named to the Kerbal Space Program, with all the rights, privileges, and responsibilities of a true government program - which Jebediah said essentially means that we all get a subsidized snack allowance going forward.\n\nThe Space Age has dawned!
