//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

//Contract Descriptions
	name = KSP-SR-40000m
	title = Fly a sounding rocket to 40,000m.
	group = Kerbal Sounding Project
	agent = Kerbal Sounding Project
	
	description = KSP is now under review by the government. There is serious talk about us being converted into a formally sponsored government program. It is believed that if we can reach 40,000 meters with a sounding rocket, we might see that government grant turn into something more permanent.
	
	synopsis = Launch the Avionics Package above 40,000m using USI sounding rocket parts, and recover it.
	
	notes = It was safe. Until Jebediah said "I think we need more boosters."
	
	completedMessage = There is a treasure trove of science data gathered on that last flight that we will use to send our first rocket into space.\n\nOur successes have enabled the government to approve future expansion of the area, which they are now calling the Kerbal Space Center. We also have grown in size and now have engineers from other organizations who have joined us.\n\nIf that wasn't enough good news, listen to this: it looks as if the Kerbal Sounding Project will be renamed to the Kerbal Space Program just as soon as we launch a rocket to the edge of space!
